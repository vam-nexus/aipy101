# Task 5 - Find Next Prime (Exercise File)
#
# ðŸ§© CHALLENGE: Create the Fibonacci sequence
#
# Requirements:
# - Create a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence
# - The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0, 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones
# - Your function should be able to generate a specified number of Fibonacci numbers
# - Consider both iterative and recursive approaches
# - Add error handling for invalid inputs (negative numbers, non-integers)
# - Make your function efficient for large numbers

# ðŸ’¡ TIP: You can use an AI assistant to help you with this task!
# Ask questions like:
# - "What's the difference between iterative and recursive Fibonacci implementations?"
# - "How do I implement memoization in Python?"
# - "What's the most efficient way to calculate large Fibonacci numbers?"
# - "How do I add error handling to mathematical functions?"
# - "What are the mathematical properties of the Fibonacci sequence?"
