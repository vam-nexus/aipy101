# Task 3 - Matplotlib Visuals (Exercise File)
#
# ðŸ§© CHALLENGE: Plot two functions, add legend, save image

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

# Create outputs directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs("outputs", exist_ok=True)
#
# Requirements:
# - Create two VERY INTERESTING different mathematical functions (e.g., linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic)
# - Plot both functions on the same graph with different colors and line styles
# - Add proper labels for x-axis, y-axis, and title
# - Include a legend to distinguish between the two functions
# - Add a grid to make the plot easier to read
# - Save the plot as an image file to outputs/ folder (use .jpg format)
# - Use appropriate x-axis range to show both functions clearly
#
# ðŸ’¡ TIP: You can use an AI assistant to help you with this task!
# Ask questions like:
# - "How do I create a quadratic function in Python?"
# - "What are the different line styles available in matplotlib?"
# - "How do I save a matplotlib plot to a file using plt.savefig()?"
# - "How can I add a legend to my plot?"
# - "What's the best way to choose colors for my plots?"
